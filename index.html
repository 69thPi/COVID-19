<div class="col-27"><pre>Ideal Procedure:</pre>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
  1. The sample is taken by keeping a sweetened cotton ball in the mouth for about 5 mins.
  2. The ball will then be spit into test tube "A" containing a buffer(denaturing medium for any other proteins and RNase)
     and a highly specific Magnetic Probe (ferrous bonded to backbone directly; NO ADSORPTION and stuff)
     targetting the RdRp part of the virus.(add something for effervesence).</br></br>
  3.A magnet is now attached to the base of the tube attracting all the Target RNA. The buffer is then poured out.Magnet is removed.</br></br>
  4.An Elution buffer is now poured into the test tube "A" having the remnant Target RNA.</br></br>
  5.Magnet is again attached; this time it pulls only the probes. And the buffer with the Target-RNA is poured into test tube "B".</br></br>
  6. Test tube "B" contains a buffer that changes color upon the action of any RNA; indicating a postive test.</br>
  (non toxic; may have aroma)

:: log 20-7</br>
Instead of amplifying the RNA (RT-PCR), we can instead use RNA as a transducer and then amplify the transducer signal.
Similar to transistors (BJT in comm. emmiter) the RNA can act as a base current that switches the reaction ON (in biological terms,
use RNA as a catalyst).
The solution mix needs to dissolve a compound having a large enough delocal. of Pi electrons to absorb color complimentary to the one in the
visible range. The delocal limits us to a combo of alternating Pi bonds and aromatic rings, leaving us with high melting points hence the
need for a dissolution buffer. A chromophore is what we are looking forward to. An auxochrome is one that enhances the delocal
of the electrons in the chromophore allowing an absorption shift in the visible spectra.</br>
My approach would be to use the phosphate backbone to prime an auxochrome and have it attach to the chromophore. In that process the
Phosphodiester is returned to its initial state (as a catalyst) and the release of a dissolution liquid that can allow the dye
to be in an aqueous form. The chromophore and auxochome musn't react directly or with any of the other species.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;border-radius:30px;background:#708090;padding:10px;">
::RNA as an activator</br>
RNA is highly susceptible to hydrolysis; even more so than DNA due to the presence of the OH on the 2' carbon atom on the ribose.
Any part of it needs to be modified to act as a nucleophillic attack molecule which activates a species A (auxochrome), for its reaction with
species B(chromophore) to form the above mentioned DYE. It is seen that RNA acts as a catalyst to promote its own formation (which is pretty cool)
but there are also evidences that suggest its catalytic nature in inorganic reactions (michaels and Diels alder.)</br>
Need to look for a way to prime the phosphate group. Digging deeper into the nature of Phosphorous.</br>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;border-radius:30px;background:#708090;padding:10px;">
::Log 27-7</br>
I've been learning that phosphorous is a very nasty element.
The size of it's nucleus, allowing the use of 3d orbital and it's electrogativity values being lesser than that of Nitrogen make it
exceptionally specific. Much like an introverted kid shielded by the deeds(electrons) his own set of limited friends to protect him from the
misdeeds of the other kids. Here's the thing about introverts..you give them a taste of something they like and they'll go out of their way to have it.
OR if they find someone similar to them it's possible they might mingle. So, my case is made here by introducing a metal cation that borrows
the electrons from the 3d orbital (which are essentially borrowed deeds from the limited friends); thereby keeping the friends closer while
allowing phosphorous to explore a new friendship with a metal. This ruins the mood of the existing friends and hence are susceptible to be replaced.
But our pal "P" being introverted itll hang on to the old friends(due to the transfer of electron pairs to the 3d orbtial) as much as possible and replacing
them would be a highly specific choice.(allows specific electrophillic attack)

::Log 28-7</br>
Latch nd attack:</br>
Phosphates show potential for the formation of hydrogen bonds with the doubly bonded oxygen. (however the strength of this hydrogen bond is
expected to be weaker due to donation of electrons to the 3d oribital) This bond could ths act as a latch and swing around a nucleophile for substitution
of the OH group. Which means the OH group needs to be the leaving group, which is hard as its very basic. Instead if we change the perspective
and see it as the incoming group and the existing nucleotides need to be worse leaving groups than OH, that clears things up a bit.
Delocal makes the nucleotides stable making it a worse leaving group compared to OH. now we just need one more leaving group that is worse than OH.
nitrogen based? or oxygen based? an oxygen based group would eliminate the need to rest the backbone for catalysis. However nitrogen is smaller.
A compound which dissociates by leaving nitrogen behind is what we are looking to make. (probably after dissication it makes a chromophore.)
so we need a chromophore that is a good leaving group compared to the nitrogen which is a bad leaving group relative to OH. the chromophore attaches
to an aromatic compund imparting color. correction: last post says combination of chromophore and auxochrome; there is no auxochrome. only a
chromophore and the compund it imparts color to.

The pKa phenomenon>></br>
we know how to extract the hydrogen..just attack the primary molecule with a base. itll form h20 and leave.
but what happens when both the molecules have OH. one disscoates to form the carboanion and the other to form water and a good leaving group.
Which one though? pKa! think of this as a chain made of hands. the oygen has two hands; one with hydrgen and the other with its respective parent
native atom, lets call them A and B. So, we have AOH and BOH. (A,B = carboxyl carbon (CA), or hydrogen(water), or a metal (Na))
so the fight btn A and B starts and they fight for hydrogen but one of them uses more strength (or B just gves up and donates) the oxygen too.
so think of pKa as the age in which the older one always loses the fight forming the carbanion with a bare oxygen.

Its all just perspective; it all points to the same thing!</br>
Im beginning to see the same old chemistry from a whole new perspective; I did understand it before but now im able to ask the right questions!
All reactions are governed by pKa differences. A pKa map of your participating chemicals helps in deciding the path taken by the reaction
and the missing links. Phosphatediesters need to be stripped off of thier OH hence destab the =O configuration. Opening a pathway for a Fluorine
atom to attack (which i assume will form a stable compound but with a higher electron density). The source of the Fluorine will be an arylhalide
which is ionized by an acid that strips the OH from the Phosphorous too (the acid forms h2O with the OH and leaves phosphate). The aryl cation
is an activated chromophore.By keeping the solvent protic (acidic relative to RNA) the fluorine will be react with the h3O+ ions and be
substituted with OH (re-setting the RNA backbone).</br>
issue: Fluoroalkanes are very stable and dont react.In order for it to decompose I need to distribute the charge (aromatic compounds)
this will reduce their pKa. I could even add EWG to the ring to enhance acidic char. but you cant have Fluorine(EDG) and EWG in the same
ring (due to stearic hinderances)[there is fascinatingly a very costly 1,2,3-trifluorobeneze].. so I can either have a tri-fluorocompund to increase the
charge density and hence make the cmpd unstable or increase the surface area by polycyclic arenes. comparing this with chromophores
to get a conjugated base primed for reaction by an auxochrome.
</p>

::Log 20-8</br>
The metals have changed the playing field. My fluorine source= NaF. It's a salt and its stable!!
I've been scared to use metals into my design because 6 non-metals and hydrogen itself
spun my head around and I couldnt handle it anymore! It was when I turned to organometal complexes
that I realised that I need to go even further into my childhood and check out my 10th grade chemistry.
"Acids, Bases and Salts". Metal ions and salts totally change the playing field. The variables have increased but
the reaction has become much more simple. Everything is now just a matter of concentration. If I can figure that out,
I wont even need a chromophore; i can detect the presence using a pH indicator. YES! the damned pH. I looked all
over organic chemistry to understand that everyhting is essentially governed by pKa, and we turns out we already have
the most simplest indicators available and its been there for years!
So now I need to recheck and see if Ive missed a step anywhere and get the other minor issues sorted!

  Ideal procedure:</br></br>
  1. The sample is taken into test tube "A" containing a buffer that has the MagProbe targetting the RdRp of the virus, and the
    denaturing medium for any other proteins and RNase (and something for effervesence).</br></br>
  2.A magnet is now attached to the base of the tube attracting all the Target RNA. The buffer is then poured out.Magnet is removed.</br></br>
  3.A dehybridizing buffer is now poured into the test tube "A" having the remnant Target RNA.</br></br>
  4.Magnet is again attached; this time it pulls only the probes. And the buffer with the T-RNA is poured into test tube "B".</br></br>
  5. Test tube "B" contains a buffer that changes color upon the action of any RNA; indicating a postive test.</br>

<p style="text-align:justify;border-radius:30px;background:#708090;padding:10px;">
::On the chemical confirmation of presence of RNA.</br>
The small quantity of taget RNA in the test buffer "B" causes the detection to be insignificant. Hence, Bial's Orcinol test
and similar reaction that involve the nucleic acid (RNA here) are defunt here.</br>
Instead the approach taken was that of a transistor in a common Em. config. acting as a switch. Where the small quantity of base current
can be used to carry out a reaction. In chemical terms use use the RNA as a catalyst that allows a color change reaction.</br>
Q> How do we cause "visible" color change?</br>
Color percieved is of complimentary nature to the wavelengths absorbed by the outermost bonding and lone electrons in a molecule.
This energy absorbed is used for excitation to anti-bonding orbitals from certain energy levels. Usally this energy gap corresponds
to the UV range hence rendering the molecule as colorless. The Energy gap decreases with the delocalization of the electrons
in a molecule and hence they absorb lower energy wavelengths; entering into the visble spectra.</br></br>
So what we do here is to use the RNA to cause a reaction that increases the delocalization of a molecule hence imparting color.</br>
If any target RNA is present in the test buffer "B" it will cause the colorless buffer to render in a colored one.

<p style="text-align:justify;border-radius:30px;background:#708090;padding:10px;">
::RNA as an activator</br>
RNA is highly susceptible to hydrolysis; even more so than DNA due to the presence of the OH on the 2' carbon atom on the ribose.
Any part of it needs to be modified to act as a nucleophillic attack molecule which activates a species A, for its reaction with
species B to form the above mentioned DYE. It is seen that RNA acts as a catalyst to promote its own formation (which is pretty cool)
but there are also evidences that suggest its catalytic nature in inorganic reactions (michaels and Diels alder.)</br>
Need to look for a way to prime the phosphate group to act as a nucleophile, which then attacks a carbonyl group and is activated.</br>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;border-radius:30px;background:#708090;padding:10px;">
:: log 20-7</br>
Instead of amplifying the RNA (RT-PCR), we can instead use RNA as a transducer and then amplify its presence.
Similar to transistors (BJT in comm. emmiter) the RNA can act as a base current that switches the reaction ON (in biological terms
use RNA as a catalyst to turn on the amplification reaction).
the solution mix has to be a liquid and has to have a large enough delocal. of Pi electrons to absorb color complimentary to one in the
visible range. The delocal limits us to a combo of alternating Pi bonds and aromatic rings. Due to the epic stability of the aromatic
compounds its logical to target the other alkene species for activation by the phosphate backbone in the RNA. (since it reactive [has a net charge]
as compared to the nucleic acid bases.) Phoshates have been shown to act as catalysts with particular funcitonal groups.
My approach would be to generate an alkene species with one of those functional groups and prime it for attack on the aromatic ring.
Fusion of rings leads to an eventual increase in melting points beyond the room temperature. (need to check for ring subs method to lower MP)
this limits us to 1 benzene ring and a species in an exocyclic arrangement with it. This aromatic compund must not react with the
alternating alkene with a  fucntional group.</br></br>
conversely we could have an aromatic exocylcic cyclix compund with a phosphate compatible functional group. Which forms a
symmetric str such as the methyl orange/red. But needs to be more delocal as a color absorption must be of higher wavelengths.</br></br>
the phosphate must be nutralized to not hydrolyse and break the backbone. (the 2' OH on sugar and the O in the PO4 (3-)).
